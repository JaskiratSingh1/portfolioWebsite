**ChronoSense** is a fun and simple SwiftUI app that helps you test your internal body clock!  
Select a duration in seconds, tap “Start,” and try to stop exactly when you think that much time has elapsed. Compare your target time vs. your actual timing and see how accurate your internal clock can be!

### Features

- **Carousel Time Selection** – Quickly pick a duration (5s…100s).
- **Timer Challenge** – Press “Start,” then “Stop” when you believe your chosen time has elapsed.
- **Results Screen** – Shows your target time, actual time, and the difference.
- **History** – View previous attempts (if enabled).
- **Onboarding** – Quick intro for first-time users.

### Privacy & Data Collection

ChronoSense does not collect any personal data. All timing results and any history data are stored locally on your device via `UserDefaults`. No tracking or analytics are performed. No data is uploaded to any server, and no personally identifiable information is collected or shared.
