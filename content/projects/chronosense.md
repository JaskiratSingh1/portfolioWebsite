**ChronoSense** is a fun and simple SwiftUI app that helps you test your internal body clock!  
Select a duration in seconds, tap “Start,” and try to stop exactly when you think that much time has elapsed. Compare your target time vs. your actual timing and see how accurate your internal clock can be!
