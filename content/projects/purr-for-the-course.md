Submitted to the BCI Gamejam 2022 ([bci.games](https://bci.games/)) and designed for use with a Motion‐Imagery Brain‐Computer Interface. Players can also play with the spacebar.

### Gameplay Instructions

Use **Unity 2020.3.15f1**, open the project, and build for your system. Run the executable and have fun!

- When all players finish a hole, it advances to the next level.
- If you only want to test a single hole, open the `GameManagerLocal` object in the `Testing-Game-Design-Walt` scene and change `currentHole` to a number between 1–5 before clicking “Start Game.”
